This directory holds the various class projects I will be completing over the course of this semester using coding for chemistry purposes! 
**I will also note that an ethics portfolio is being separately kept to reflect on the ethics of information sharing and AI use in chemical analysis and research.**

-My first project included a simple test code as well as 
a program using the python 'matplotlib' package to find 
and plot data about the first 10 linear alkanes, namely 
the boiling points. 

-My second project here is a PubChem chemical search tool 
that uses an external window GUI to simplify the search
function. A simple data summary pops up after searching
that includes molecular weight, molecular formula, IUPAC 
name, and more. 

-The third vibe coding project serves a similar purpose
to the second one, focused on giving a user information 
about a chemical by using a search function. This one also
displays a bond-line drawing of the chemical after searching
via SMILES.

-My fourth and fifth projects tackle statistics, focusing on 
building basic prediction charts for missing data and using Python 
code to create diagrams for data we desire.
