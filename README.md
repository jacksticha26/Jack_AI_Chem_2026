This directory holds the various inclass projects I will be completeing over the course of this semester using coding for chemistry purposes! 
**I will also note that and ethics portfolio is being separately kept to reflect on the ethics of information sharing and AI use in chemical analysis and research.**

My first project included a simple test code as well as a program using the python 'matplotlib' package to find and plot data about the first 10 linear alkanes, namely the boiling points.
